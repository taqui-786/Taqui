## Libraries I Used

Here is a list of the main libraries I used to build this project and why I picked them:

*   **Next.js 16**: I used this because it is the best framework for building fast and modern websites.
*   **React 19**: This is the main tool I used to build all the components you see on the screen.
*   **TypeScript**: I used this to stop me from making silly mistakes in my code.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: This let me style the website really fast and make it look professional.
*   **Framer Motion**: I added this to make cool animations so the site feels fun and alive.
*   **Lenis**: This makes the scrolling feel buttery smooth and premium, which I really like.
*   **Next View Transitions**: I used this so the page changes look seamless and not clunky.
*   **React Hook Form**: This made building the contact form way easier than doing it from scratch.
*   **Zod**: I used this to double-check that the info people type in forms is correct.
*   **React Hot Toast**: This shows those nice little pop-up messages when you submit a form.
*   **Hugeicons**: I chose these icons because they are very clean and look sharp.
*   **Nodemailer**: This allows the website to actually send emails to my inbox.
